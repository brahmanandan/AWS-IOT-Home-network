# Device Shadow Controller Script for IoT-Bed

This script connects to the AWS IoT device shadow via MQTT and sends BLE commands using `gatttool` to resolve deltas in the device shadow.

## Overview

Features:

- Bed position presets: Zero-G, Flat, TV/PC
- Massage setting: head and foot 4 levels on and off.

> See the [BLE Control](../../docs/02_BLE_CONTROL.md) guide for details on the BLE protocol.

Sometimes the `gatttool` commands error out so the script tries to send the commands up to 3 times before giving up.

### Faking the Massage 'off' command

Since the massage setting is a single action button to increase massage level, there is no "off" command. The operator has to cycle through all of the massage levels before it turns off.

The state of `massage` is stored as an integer between `0` and `100` that increments by `25` whenever the `massage on` lambda action is fired.

To simulate the "off" command, the Lambda function takes the current value of the massage level, for example `50` and makes it negative, `-50`, the shadow controller script sees that the change is less than 0 so it computes the number of massage levels needed to get back to `0` and sends that many commands in sequence.

```
num_cmds = int((100 - abs(massagePercent)) / 25)
```

### Implementing custom head and foot adjustment angles

Since there is no way to directly command a head or foot angle, adding the ability to control the angle is going to be tricky.

## Running with systemd

Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -U AWSIoTPythonSDK
```

Copy the certs and root CA to the same directory as the script before running.

- `device.pem`: IoT certificate
- `device-key.pem`: IoT private key
- `root-CA.crt`: root CA for certificate.

> See the [IoT Device guide](../../docs/03_IOT_DEVICE.md) for how to create the thing and certs.

Export the environment variables:

```
export IOT_ENDPOINT=$(aws iot describe-endpoint | jq -r '.endpointAddress')
export THING_NAME=iot-bed
export BLE_ADDRESS=ADDRESS_OF_BLE_BASE
```

Run the script:

```
python iot-bed.py
```

## Installing as a systemd service

Install script and certs to `/opt/iot-bed` and run as a systemd service:

```
cat > iot-bed.service <<"EOF"
[Unit]
Description=IoT Bed Controller
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

```

```
sed -i \

```

```
sudo mv iot-bed.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable iot-bed
sudo systemctl start iot-bed
```

```
sudo systemctl status iot-bed --no-pager
```

> Remember to copy the certs `device*` and root CA `root-CA.crt` to `/opt/iot-bed/` before starting.

## Installing and running with Docker

### or with docker-compose on HypriotOS with RPI3

Install [HypriotOS](https://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/) on your Raspberry Pi 3

```
git clone https://github.com/danisla/iot-bed.git
```

Copy your `device-key.pem` `device.pem` `device.pub` and `root-CA.crt` to the `src/iot/` directory.

```
cd iot-bed/src/iot
cat > .env <<"EOF"
IOT_ENDPOINT=YOUR IOT ENDPOINT
THING_NAME=iot-bed
BLE_ADDRESS=YOUR BLE ADDRESS
EOF
```

```
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```
